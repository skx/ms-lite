Installing
----------

  To run this code you need to install qpsmtpd and then configure it
 to use the plugins.

  In short you need to run:

     apt-get install qpsmtpd
     rm /etc/qpsmtpd/*
     cp ./etc/qpsmtpd/* /etc/qpsmtpd/


  Now you can copy the plugins into place:

      mkdir /usr/share/qpsmtpd/plugins.local
      cp -R plugins/* /usr/share/qpsmtpd/plugins.local/

  This should now allow you to restart qpsmtpd and have everything work,
 but to be sure you'll need to setup the spam archive, and add a domain
 as per-the readme instructions:

    mkdir /spam
    chmod 777 /spam

    mkdir -p /srv/steve.org.uk/
    etc.
