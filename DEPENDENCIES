Dependencies
------------


Mail Handling
-------------

To recieve mail you'll need qpsmtpd, which will be configured to
run the plugins located beneath ./plugins/

Some of the plugins have additional dependencies they are listed
here:

  apt-get install libsys-cpuload-perl



IPv6 Support
------------

If you wish to run QPSMTPD with IPv6 support you'll also need:

  apt-get install  libsocket6-perl  libio-socket-inet6-perl



Quarantine Display
------------------

To view the quarantine of rejected mail for a domain you'll need to
have Apache2 installed, and copy the single script in ./cgi-bin/ to
/usr/lib/cgi-bin.

Don't forget to ACL this script as it will allow others to view your
rejected email(s) too.
