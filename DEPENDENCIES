Mail Handling
-------------

  To recieve mail you'll need qpsmtpd, which will be configured to
 run the plugins located beneath plugins.

  Some of the plugins have additional dependencies they are listed
 here:

  apt-get install libsys-cpuload-perl



Quarantine Display
------------------

  To view the quarantine of rejected mail for a domain you'll need to
 have Apache2 installed, and copy the single script in ./cgi-bin/ to
 /usr/lib/cgi-bin.

  Don't forget to ACL this script as it will allow others to view your
 mail instead.
