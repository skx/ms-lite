# Selects the log level for qpsmtpd's builtin (stderr) logging.  Any message at
# or below the severity level will be logged unless further excluded by the log
# plugin configuration (see /etc/qpsmtpd/logging).  Lower values are more
# urgent.
#
# This setting normally takes effect only at startup, prior to daemon startup
# and initialization of the usual logging plugin.  It does not apply to the
# individual logging plugins, whose thresholds are specified in the logging
# plugin configuration, /etc/qpsmtpd/logging .
