# spool_dir -- this setting controls the directory used as temporary and
# spooling space by qpsmtpd.  In most configurations it should not be
# adjusted from the installation default.
#
# Because qpsmtpd does not generally do any actual mail delivery (generally
# done by the local MTA instead), its spool space is generally used as a
# private temporary directory by various plugins to pass copies of mail to
# external programs.  Actual spooling of undelivered mail is generally very
# short-lived, as the queue plugin will have handed off the mail before the
# SMTP transaction completes (as compared to store-and-forward spools used
# by MTAs doing remote delivery.)
